Knights is a logical puzzle based on "Knights and Knaves" puzzle. In this puzzle, the 
followning information is given: Each character is either a knight or a knave. A 
knight will always tell the truth  (aka if a knight states a sentence, then the 
sentence is true). Conversely, a knave will always lie (aka if a knave states a sentence, 
then the sentence is false). The objective of the puzzle is, given a set of sentences 
spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether that character 
is a knight or a knave.
