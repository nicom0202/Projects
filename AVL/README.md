## Fast Data Structure for Text Insertions and Range Queries

*Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project involves designing a fast data structure in C/C++ to perform insertions and range queries on text. The input file contains a long list of words to insert (i), interspersed with range queries (r). The goal is to efficiently find the number of words lexicographically between two given strings.
