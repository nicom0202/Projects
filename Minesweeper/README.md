## AI Makes Safest Move Using Propositional Logic

🔹Overview🔹
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells 
contain hidden “mines.” Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and 
causes the user to lose the game. Clicking on a “safe” cell (i.e., a cell that does not 
contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells – where a neighbor 
is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – 
contain a mine.
